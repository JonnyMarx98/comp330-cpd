# Weekly Reports

# Term One

## Week 1 - Beginning 24th September


In the first week I had a few small challenges to overcome. Firstly trying to refine my dissertation research question and write up a short proposal was quite hard as I wasn't sure what my question should be. It wasn't too hard to find academic papers about my topic, but it was hard to find gaps in literature that I could fill and base my reaserch on. Another problem I had this week was getting back into using unreal and blueprints, this was a small challenge since I hadn't used unreal much for a long time. By the end of the week I felt comfortable with the engine again. 

## Week 2 - Beginning 1st October


During this week I continued to struggle with finding a good research question for my dissertation project. What didn't help was the amount of procrastination I was doing, most likely because I had not done much work over summer so I am not in the habbit of doing work each day. To counter my procrastination I will set myself small goals that I have to reach each day before I can have some free time to do something entertaining like playing games. I have also set my google homepage to a quote about procrastination to hopefully motivate me each time I open google chrome.

## Week 3 - Beginnng 8th October


This week I prototyped some mechanics for my collaborative team game. This wasn't a big challenge for me, however there were a few things I didn't know so I had to look online for help. In future I would like to be able to solve problems without needing to look online for help, to improve my knowledge of programming for unreal I will spend half an hour a day practicing it. Another challenge this week was presenting my NES de-make, I have never been confident presenting even with a very short presentation like this. To improve on this I will practice presenting to some friends and family before my next presentation and ask them for some feedback. 

## Week 4 - Beginning 15th October


This week we started using Javascript to develop an application for our professional website assignment. As this was a language I had never used before it was hard to understand the example code that we had been given, which meant I needed to do some practice before I start developing the final application. To practice Javascript I will complete a short course on Udemy [Code Your First Game: Arcade Classic in JavaScript on Canvas](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/), this will give me a basic understanding of javascript. From there I will then start to develop my game and learn more during this process. Ed also introduced us to 6502 programming this week and it looks like it will take a lot of practice in order to develop a decent NES de-make. At the moment I only understand a little bit of it so I will watch Ed's live code videos to gain a better understanding of how 6502 works. 

## Week 5 - Beginning 22nd October


After completing the Udemy course over the weekend, I started to develop a simple game to show at the peer review at the end of the week. I now have a good understanding of how Javascript works, however my code is not nearly as comprehensive and well-structered as the example code gareth gave us, so I have a lot of room for improvement. Hopefully I can get some useful feedback from my peers at the peer-review. I have been struggling a lot with get anything done for my dissertation, I find it very hard to focus on it and read papers, especially when the deadline is far away because I always put it off for another day. This has always been a struggle for me, especially for any research and written based projects. In an attempt to improve this I will read a small amount each day, this is better than not doing anything, and I plan to increase how much I read each day as the deadline comes closer. 

## Week 6 - Beginning 29th October


This week was reading week, during this week I struggled a lot with procrastination and time managment. I didn't do as much work as I planned to do during this week, however I did make a decent amount of progress towards my dissertation and Javascript game. I struggled the most with the dissertation, I found it really hard to focus on reading through lots of papers and picking out the useful information. Since I only had 500 words prior to reading week I wanted to use this time to write a large chunk of it, I planned on bringing my word count up to 2500, however I only managed to get to around 1200. I spent the last few days of reading week working on my Javascript game and found it much easier to focus since it was a lot more enjoyable. I made quite good progresss with it. The key challenges this week were time management and procrastination. To avoid procrastination I will wake up earlier and do my work first thing in the morning, this means there will be less distractions and I will hopefully be less tempted to do something else. To improve time management I will start a weekly journal in which I plan out which days I will work on each task, and give myself a goal time to complete it. 

## Week 7 - Beginning 5th November


The biggest challenge for me this week was definetely the dissertation presentation. This was the longest presentation I have had to do at university so far, I was extremely nervous for it. I had to present my findings so far, what I plan to write about, and what my method will be. I had not done as much research as I would have liked, so I was worried my presentation would not be good at all. Despite previously planning on practicing it to my friends or family I only practiced it to myself at home. I believe practicing it to myself helped a little bit but it would have been better to practice it in front of someone. Another challenge this week was getting properly started on my NES de-make, I had not done much for it at all because I kept putting it off. This was very stressful because I needed to do a lot of practice for it in a short amount of time. To catch up on the work I didn't do I am going to finish wacthing all the live code videos before next week and work on it everyday next week. 

## Week 8 - Beginning 12th November


Last week I submitted my Javascript game for the professional website assignment, I was fairly happy with it, however I still believe it could have been a bit better if I had put some more time into it. This week we had a dissertation peer review, this pushed me to work harder on my dissertation and get some work done. I managed to write over 1000 words this week however it felt a bit rushed as I wrote most of that the morning before the peer review. Because I wanted to have something decent for the peer review I pushed NES asside this week and only worked on it a little bit. I should have spread my work between the two assignments more evenly, as now I will have a lot more NES work to do next week. To improve my management of what work to do I will make the weekly journal I planned to make a couple weeks ago. I will make this on google sheets and set the page as my google chrome home page so that I see it everytime I open google chrome. I haven't mentioned the team game progress in a while, I had been slacking a bit in the last few weeks because I was spending more time on the other assignments because the deadlines were coming up. However the game is progressing well and it is the best team game I have worked on so far. 

## Week 9 - Beginning 19th November


I spent the majority of this week working on my NES de-make as the deadline was on monday next week. At the start of the week I was still struggling a lot and it was taking me a long time to get anything working, however after many hours of struggle I eventually started to make quite a lot of progress. I actually made a better game than I expected to be able to make. I implemented most of the mechanics I proposed in my presentation earlier in the term, including climbing, ranged and melee combat. Despite making good progress with my NES de-make I was very stressed this week because I still had a lot of dissertation work to do and felt that was very far behind. Next term I plan to start working on the big projects much earlier on to decrease my work load towards the end of term as this is when I usually get most stressed. I will use the my time managemnent journal to plan out how much time to spend on each assignment. 

## Week 10 - Beginning 26th November


After spending the majority of last week working on my NES de-make for the viva I had a ton of work to do for my dissertation. This is exactly what I didn't want to happen, I was hoping that this term I would have got my work done earlier and used these final weeks before the deadline to clean up my work and make sure it is perfect. I still had a lot of reading to do and a lot to write about, as well as still being a little bit unsure on what my methodology will actually be. This was probably the most stressful part of the week, I was told that I had overscoped on my original idea to create 2 escape rooms, one you can only complete with a hololens and one without. I struggled a lot when trying to think about what I actually want to test and measure, eventually I chose to compare learning experience with and without a hololens for one puzzle, however this meant I needed to do even more reading into learning and education with augmented reality. I feel that this also comes down to time management, just like some of the other challenges I have had this term, so to improve this I will use my time management journal next term. 

## Week 11 - Beginning 3rd December


I was feeling a lot less stressed this week since a lot of the big deadlines were out of the way. I spent a lot of this week working on the team game, trying to catch up on time that I had spent in the last few weeks on other assignments. I didn't have any big challenges this week, other than a few programming problems while working on the team game, but it was nothing I couldn't figure out within an hour or so. I would say my motivation to start working on my dissertation artefact was low, which was probably the biggest struggle this week as I need to start it sooner rather than later. I think the stress from the last few weeks put me off doing any work that I think might be stressful. To overcome this I should stop putting off tasks I don't want to do by just doing a small amount rather than nothing, because a start is better than nothing and provbides some momentum. 

## Week 12 - Beginnimg 10th December


The last week before the christmas break, I had finally started working on my artefact this week and made some progress with that. I was happy to add some final touches to the team game and submit it. I am really happy with what our team has created this year, I believe it is a really fun game that has a lot of potential next term and I'm excited to work on it and see how it improves and develops next term. Played some beat saber to celebrate the end of term (almost still got 2 things to submit in January). My biggest challenge this week was trying to remember how to develop for the hololens and how to use the holotoolkit. This can easily be overcome with some practice and looking back at my work from last year. 



## Summary 


My plans for what I do after university are not certain at the moment, however I would like to be a programmer of some kind. Unlike previous years I am not completly sure I want to persue a games development career, I would like to experiment with other software development or website development after university. If I do decide to do games development, my goal would be to start out by making games independtly or in a small team, and then potentially move to a large game development company after that. The five key challenges I have identified this semester are not asking for help, specializing in a programming language, portfolio, self discipline, and breaking down tasks. To overcome not asking for help the only thing I can do is ask for help. I plan to specialize in C# by developing mobile games in my spare time in unity, I will then add these games to my portfolio to show that I have good C# skills. To improve self discpline I will work on the tasks I favour the least before doing any other work and reward myself for doing so. I will also break big dauting tasks down so that I am more likely to start and complete them.
