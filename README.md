# Weekly Reports

# Term One

## Week 1 - Beginning 24th September


In the first week I had a few small challenges to overcome. Firstly trying to refine my dissertation research question and write up a short proposal was quite hard as I wasn't sure what my question should be. It wasn't too hard to find academic papers about my topic, but it was hard to find gaps in literature that I could fill and base my reaserch on. Another problem I had this week was getting back into using unreal and blueprints, this was a small challenge since I hadn't used unreal much for a long time. By the end of the week I felt comfortable with the engine again. 

## Week 2 - Beginning 1st October


During this week I continued to struggle with finding a good research question for my dissertation project. What didn't help was the amount of procrastination I was doing, most likely because I had not done much work over summer so I am not in the habbit of doing work each day. To counter my procrastination I will set myself small goals that I have to reach each day before I can have some free time to do something entertaining like playing games. I have also set my google homepage to a quote about procrastination to hopefully motivate me each time I open google chrome.

## Week 3 - Beginnng 8th October


This week I prototyped some mechanics for my collaborative team game. This wasn't a big challenge for me, however there were a few things I didn't know so I had to look online for help. In future I would like to be able to solve problems without needing to look online for help, to improve my knowledge of programming for unreal I will spend half an hour a day practicing it. Another challenge this week was presenting my NES de-make, I have never been confident presenting even with a very short presentation like this. To improve on this I will practice presenting to some friends and family before my next presentation and ask them for some feedback. 

## Week 4 - Beginning 15th October


This week we started using Javascript to develop an application for our professional website assignment. As this was a language I had never used before it was hard to understand the example code that we had been given, which meant I needed to do some practice before I start developing the final application. To practice Javascript I will complete a short course on Udemy [Code Your First Game: Arcade Classic in JavaScript on Canvas](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/), this will give me a basic understanding of javascript. From there I will then start to develop my game and learn more during this process. Ed also introduced us to 6502 programming this week and it looks like it will take a lot of practice in order to develop a decent NES de-make. At the moment I only understand a little bit of it so I will watch Ed's live code videos to gain a better understanding of how 6502 works. 

## Week 5 - Beginning 22nd October


After completing the Udemy course over the weekend, I started to develop a simple game to show at the peer review at the end of the week. I now have a good understanding of how Javascript works, however my code is not nearly as comprehensive and well-structered as the example code gareth gave us, so I have a lot of room for improvement. Hopefully I can get some useful feedback from my peers at the peer-review. I have been struggling a lot with get anything done for my dissertation, I find it very hard to focus on it and read papers, especially when the deadline is far away because I always put it off for another day. This has always been a struggle for me, especially for any research and written based projects. In an attempt to improve this I will read a small amount each day, this is better than not doing anything, and I plan to increase how much I read each day as the deadline comes closer. 

## Week 6 - Beginning 29th October


This week was reading week, during this week I struggled a lot with procrastination and time managment. I didn't do as much work as I planned to do during this week, however I did make a decent amount of progress towards my dissertation and Javascript game. I struggled the most with the dissertation, I found it really hard to focus on reading through lots of papers and picking out the useful information. Since I only had 500 words prior to reading week I wanted to use this time to write a large chunk of it, I planned on bringing my word count up to 2500, however I only managed to get to around 1200. I spent the last few days of reading week working on my Javascript game and found it much easier to focus since it was a lot more enjoyable. I made quite good progresss with it. The key challenges this week were time management and procrastination. To avoid procrastination I will wake up earlier and do my work first thing in the morning, this means there will be less distractions and I will hopefully be less tempted to do something else. To improve time management I will start a weekly journal in which I plan out which days I will work on each task, and give myself a goal time to complete it. 

## Week 7 - Beginning 5th November


The biggest challenge for me this week was definetely the dissertation presentation. This was the longest presentation I have had to do at university so far, I was extremely nervous for it. I had to present my findings so far, what I plan to write about, and what my method will be. I had not done as much research as I would have liked, so I was worried my presentation would not be good at all. Despite previously planning on practicing it to my friends or family I only practiced it to myself at home. I believe practicing it to myself helped a little bit but it would have been better to practice it in front of someone. Another challenge this week was getting properly started on my NES de-make, I had not done much for it at all because I kept putting it off. This was very stressful because I needed to do a lot of practice for it in a short amount of time. To catch up on the work I didn't do I am going to finish wacthing all the live code videos before next week and work on it everyday next week. 

## Week 8 - Beginning 12th November


Last week I submitted my Javascript game for the professional website assignment, I was fairly happy with it, however I still believe it could have been a bit better if I had put some more time into it. This week we had a dissertation peer review, this pushed me to work harder on my dissertation and get some work done. I managed to write over 1000 words this week however it felt a bit rushed as I wrote most of that the morning before the peer review. Because I wanted to have something decent for the peer review I pushed NES asside this week and only worked on it a little bit. I should have spread my work between the two assignments more evenly, as now I will have a lot more NES work to do next week. To improve my management of what work to do I will make the weekly journal I planned to make a couple weeks ago. I will make this on google sheets and set the page as my google chrome home page so that I see it everytime I open google chrome. I haven't mentioned the team game progress in a while, I had been slacking a bit in the last few weeks because I was spending more time on the other assignments because the deadlines were coming up. However the game is progressing well and it is the best team game I have worked on so far. 

## Week 9 - Beginning 19th November


I spent the majority of this week working on my NES de-make as the deadline was on monday next week. At the start of the week I was still struggling a lot and it was taking me a long time to get anything working, however after many hours of struggle I eventually started to make quite a lot of progress. I actually made a better game than I expected to be able to make. I implemented most of the mechanics I proposed in my presentation earlier in the term, including climbing, ranged and melee combat. Despite making good progress with my NES de-make I was very stressed this week because I still had a lot of dissertation work to do and felt that was very far behind. Next term I plan to start working on the big projects much earlier on to decrease my work load towards the end of term as this is when I usually get most stressed. I will use the my time managemnent journal to plan out how much time to spend on each assignment. 

## Week 10 - Beginning 26th November




During this week I spent a lot of time working on my hololens project, I was having problems deploying my game to the hololens which was making it harder to develop because I couldn't test the game. After asking Al for some help I managed to get it working and I could test the game. I'm glad I asked for help rather than spending hours trying to figure it out by myself. A big challenge I faced was implementing a random item spawner for my collaborative game, I couldn't figure out how to ensure that an item wouldn't spawn in a used spawn point. I didn't ask for help for this and it took me a long time to solve this problem. I believe if I was more proficient at C# it would not have taken me so long so I plan to do a couple hours of C# practice a at least two days each week. 

## last year stuff below




## Week 11 - Beginning 3rd December


This week Brian showed us how to create a class for game objects in our OpenGL projects, this was very helpful as it allowed us to easily render multiple objects in the scene. However it also meant I had to put change the C++ code that allowed bullet physics to work with my model to work with the game object class. I spent some time attempting to do this but because I couldn't do it I decided to postpone it until I had finished my other projects which were due before this. I think with some more C++ practice I will be able to solve small problems like this fairly easily. I can get this practice by working on my OpenGL project over christmas and also try some C++ challenges on hackerrank.com.

## Week 12 - Beginnimg 10th December


At the beggining of this week I was finishing my hololens project for the peer review, over the weekend I was having some issues with spacial mapping and scale but with some time I managed to sort it out in time. I got a lot of positive feedback about my project which I was very happy with, however I had to remove a song that I had in the game due to copyright issues. I also started working on a camera class for my OpenGL project and couldn't quite figure out how to get it working so I left it to do over christmas. This is something I do far too often, I will start something, get stuck and then stop working on it because I don't want to try solve the problem then. I've set myself a new goal of finishing everything I start, this will mean I won't stop working on something before I finished what I planned to have done.

## Summary 
My career goals haven't changed since last year, I still aspire to being a successful game developer in the future whether that is through starting a small indie development team, working in a large company and making AAA games or even freelancing. Now that I am half way through this degree I feel that I have learnt a huge amount about game development and believe that I have developed some good programming/scripting skills through making games and working on various projects involving programming. Five key challenges I have faced this term were communication, asking for help, problem solving, programming proficiency, and dedication. To overcome commuication I will make sure that If I have an idea or opinion I won't keep it to myself I will talk to my team about it, in addition to this if I need some help I will ask one of my teams programmers for help to improve my asking for help. To improve my programming proficiency I will complete challenges or hackerrank.com and work on my programming projects more often, this will also improve my problem solving skills. To overcome my lack of dedication I will reward myself when I complete work without delaying it and I will think about how I will benefit from doing the task earlier rather than later.

# Term Two

## Week 1 - Beginning 28th January


First week back, there wasn't many big challenges, although I do feel like I could have done more work on my collaborative game this week. I did very little work over the 3 weeks prior to teaching which didn't help me get back into working regularly. In addition to this I found it hard to know what to implement to our game, probably due to the lack of good sprint planning.

## Week 2 - Beginning 4th February


I started to do some more work on the team game this week but probably still not as much as I should be doing. I've been enjoying the modules this term so far, particularly AI. I'm excited to learn more about advanced AI and hope to implement some into my team game. Didn't have any significant challenges this week.

## Week 3 - Beginning 11th February


This week I did some more work on the team game, AI in particular. I had some challenges while implementing the basic zombie AI but after I spent enough time working on it I managed to fix most of the issues. The lectures were again very interseting this week, learning a lot about distributed systems, AI, and business.

## Week 4 - Beginning 18th February


This week I found out that I had an assignment due the following week so I spent the whole week focusing on that. It was very challenging trying to understand how to get the threading working on both the clients and the server in order to send messages to all the clients at the right time. I made a bit of progress each day and eventually had a fairly decent MUD working with both local and global chat implemented. Another challenge was trying not to neglect working on the team game this week, but found it hard to focus on working on it since I was more focused on finishing the MUD.

## Week 5 - Beginning 25th February


I spent a lot of time trying to get behaviour trees to work for my game component AI this week. There wasn't much online help so it was very hard to figure out how everything in the behaviour machine plugin worked. In the end I couldn't get it to do what I wanted it to do so I continued working on it just using scripting to be ready for the peer review next week.

## Week 6 - Beginning 4th March


During reading week I didn't do as much work as I could have, but I did at least do some. I started working on some of my upcoming research journals and essays, I should have also worked on the team game this week but didn't do that. I found my self procrastinating a lot this week. This has always been a problem of mine, I plan to start a self improvement journal in which I will set my self some goals at the start of each day and tick them off, this way I can see my progress and I will always know what to work on. 

## Week 7 - Beginning 11th February


This week we had to present our business cases, I was fairly nervous about this however it wasn't as bad as I expected. After presenting gareth gave me some good feedback that helped me prepare my report over the weekend for the peer review. I had not started the report yet so I spent a lot of time over this weekend working on it, which was my biggest challenge this week.

## Week 8 - Beginning 18th March


This week I got pretty stressed trying to finsihing the research journals and business case before the deadlines during this week. The most challenging one was the business case since it was so long, but I worked together with some friends and we got it done by the deadline. Next time I would like to have the work done the week before so I don't stress about it so much. 

## Week 9 - Beginning 8th April


After coming back from my easter break not having done any work over easter, I was hit with the realisation that I still have quite a lot of work to do and not that long left to do it. Because I hadn't worked on the team game over easter I was quite worried that my team would not be happy with me, which probably just made it worse because it made me not want to confront them. I didn't do much work this week, this was due to stress, not knowing where to start or what to work on and procrastination. All of these are things I need to improve. 

## Week 10 - Beginning 15th April


This week I decided to try getting the behaviour trees to work again, after hours of struggling I finally got something, It was the first step. I left it there for now planning to go back to it at a later date to finish it off. I then also began working on my microRTS bot but didn't really understand it and didn't know where to start with it. 

## Week 11 - Beginning 22nd April


I came back to the game AI this week and continued trying to get the behaviour trees doing what I wanted them to do but I just couldn't figure it out so I ended up polishing what I already had with the scripts and submitting that. The peer review for the microRTS bots was posponed a week and instead Ed showed us how to get started with our bots. This was very helpful and by the end of the week I had I pretty good bot in the top 5 on the class leaderboard.

## Week 12 Beginning 29th April


With the AI submitted the one big assignment remaining was the client server task. This has been the most challenging assignment this term, without the help from gareth I would still be stuck not knowing how to put a database into my program. I came into the studio most days this week and worked on this client server task, struggling each day and getting stressed about countless errors. After gareth showed us how to implement SQL into the basic SUD program I figured it all out and got it working with my MUD.

## Summary 

My career goals remain the same, I would like to be a game developer, I am still unsure what exactly I what to do within the industry however. After doing the business case report I would like to experiment with both self publishing and taking publisher deals. I would like to work in an indie team and would also like to work in a AAA company. Over the last term I think my programming knowledge has improved quite a lot, I am now much more confident and now know C sharp and Java fairly well. I'm glad that I have programmed in various different languages as it broadens my programming competency. Five key challenges I have faced this term were, team work, motivation, productiveness, assignment time management, and prioritising. To overcome not working very well as a team I will get to know my team as early as possible next year as I find it much easier to communicate with people I know. To improve my motivation I am going to create a self improvement/gratitude journal to track my work and make me feel better and hopefully more motivated to do work. This journal should also help me be more productive because I will set myself tasks to complete each day so I won't spend to much time not knowing what to work on. To improve assignment time management I will look at the module guides and make sure I work on each assignment for the right amount of time by tracking my hours on a spreadsheet. I will overcome my prioritising problem by using the spreadsheet for time management to set my goals for each day so I do the right amount of work for each assignment.
