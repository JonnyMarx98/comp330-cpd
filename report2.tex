\section*{Introduction}
My career goals remain the same, I would like to be a game developer, I am still unsure what exactly I what to do within the industry however. After doing the business case report I would like to experiment with both self publishing and taking publisher deals. I would like to work in an indie team and would also like to work in a AAA company. Over the last term I think my programming knowledge has improved quite a lot, I am now much more confident and now know C sharp and Java fairly well. I'm glad that I have programmed in various different languages as it broadens my programming competency. Five key challenges I have faced this term were, team work, motivation, productiveness, assignment time management, and prioritising. To overcome not working very well as a team I will get to know my team as early as possible next year as I find it much easier to communicate with people I know. To improve my motivation I am going to create a self improvement/gratitude journal to track my work and make me feel better and hopefully more motivated to do work. This journal should also help me be more productive because I will set myself tasks to complete each day so I won't spend to much time not knowing what to work on. To improve assignment time management I will look at the module guides and make sure I work on each assignment for the right amount of time by tracking my hours on a spreadsheet. I will overcome my prioritising problem by using the spreadsheet for time management to set my goals for each day so I do the right amount of work for each assignment.
