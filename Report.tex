\section*{Introduction}


My career goals haven't changed since last year, I still aspire to being a successful game developer in the future whether that is through starting a small indie development team, working in a large company and making AAA games or even freelancing. Now that I am half way through this degree I feel that I have learnt a huge amount about game development and believe that I have developed some good programming/scripting skills through making games and working on various projects involving programming. Five key challenges I have faced this term were communication, asking for help, problem solving, programming proficiency, and dedication. I will highlight these five skills in my report by acknowledging the challenges I faced then suggesting how I will overcome the obstacle in relation to a SMART action.
